**Deep learning-based Random Noise Denoising for Seismic Data**

This is a repository for my final project assignment in Machine Learning in Geophysics course at Institut Teknologi Bandung.
The objective of the final project is to implement a deep learning approach to solve geophysical issues. It is up to the students
which topic/issue they prefer to solve. However, I have a strong interest in implementing computer vision based algorithm to solve
issues in geophysics. That's why I'm trying to deploy the U-Net architecture (Ronneberger, 2015) to do denoising for random noise
in seismic data. I found my final project really fun and so that this project will be my independent research project that
i will develop during my free time and I will be very open to any discussion regarding this project. So, feel free to hit me up 
if you have any idea that can be useful for this project :D
