# Deep learning-based Random Noise Denoising for Seismic Data

This is a repository for my final project assignment in Machine Learning in Geophysics course at Institut Teknologi Bandung.
The objective of the final project is to implement a deep learning approach to solve geophysical issues. It is up to the students
which topic/issue they prefer to solve. However, I have a strong interest in implementing computer vision based algorithm to solve
issues in geophysics. That's why I'm trying to deploy the U-Net architecture (Ronneberger, 2015) to do denoising for random noise
in seismic data. 

I found my final project really fun and so that this project will be my independent research project that
i will develop during my free time and I will be very open to any discussion regarding this project. So, feel free to hit me up 
if you have any idea that can be useful for this project :D

## Project Overview
Seismic data plays a critical role in subsurface exploration, such as oil and gas exploration, earthquake monitoring, and 
geotechnical studies. However, seismic signals are often contaminated with random noise, which can obscure valuable subsurface information. 

Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like U-Net, has shown great potential in enhancing 
signal-to-noise ratios while preserving intricate details. The diagram below represents the flowchart that being used in this project
